# Weather App

The Weather App shows the current temperature at the location of the phone.

## Project Structure

The app scripts can be found at: `Assets\Features`

The architecture used follows the MVC pattern.

### Features

1. **MainService**: It's a MonoBehaviour, applied to the MainService object in the Hierarchy. This service takes care of organizing the other services to perform the required business logic.
2. **Other services**: The rest of the services implement the IService interface. It has OnComplete and OnFail events and the StartService method. For services requiring StartService to take params, there is the IServiceWithParameters Interface.
    - **WeatherLocationService**: Takes care of fetching the GPS location of the phone. The asynchronous operations while initializing phone location service are handled with the async/await pattern.
    - **WeatherAPIService**: Takes GPS location as an input and fetches the temperature for that location for the current day. The asynchronous web request operation is handled again with async/await, where the UnityWebRequestAwaiter Extension method was created to help with awaiting UnityWebRequest.

3. **Tests**: There is also `Assets\Tests` folder where you can find tests for some of the key services and functionalities. To run the tests, go to Unity - Window - General - Test Runner.

4. **Build**: In `Assets\Build`, the WeatherApp.apk is included.
